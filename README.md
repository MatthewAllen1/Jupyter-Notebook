I had heard a lot about Jupyter Notebook but never used it. I've always used VSCode. I like how clean Jupyter Notebook is and how everything is a fresh stacked layout. I used mambaforge to install my packages and launch Jupyter Notebook. I used the Tips dataset, this is a pretty common dataset for a classroom setting I feel like. I made a basic scatterplot and some other simple visuals. Check it out.
