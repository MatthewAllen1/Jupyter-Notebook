I had heard a lot about Jupyter Notebook and decided to try to use it. I like how clean it is and how everything is a stacked layout. I need to study more on it but I wanted to get it working and gain familiarity. I used mambaforge to install my packages and launch Jupyter Notebook. I made a basic scatterplot, this is as basic as it gets but I'm glad I learned what Jupyter Notebook is. I need to dig more into it.
